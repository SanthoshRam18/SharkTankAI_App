SharkTankAI is a Streamlit-based web app that uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to analyze and classify startup pitches based on their content. Inspired by the intensity of Shark Tank-style decisions, this tool leverages NLP to assess whether a pitch is likely to be "investable" or not. Built for founders, investors, and enthusiasts, the app combines deep learning with a clean UI to deliver fast, intelligent insights from raw pitch text.
